# Atomichan Cpp study application

Questions:

1.
I want to divide source file into three (four?) files.
After having divided the file, I came across the following errors from Liner:
-----     -----
vscode âžœ /workspaces/CppOfficeHour (main) $ cmake --build build

When I keep call_f function inside my header file (B.h), I can compile and runt the programm.
Where is wrong?

2. (if possible)
Then, I want to move a function defined in app/myApp.cpp (line 28-31) to myutils, into a header and source file, with defining a namespace, and if possible, make some generalization with typename directive, so that I can use this function for other type of classes inherited from class A (which is an abstract class).
